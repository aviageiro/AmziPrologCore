</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1> <b><font color="#0000FF">VBGene - ODBC Visual Basic Genealogical Sample</font></b></h1>
The DBGene sample application uses a classic Prolog application idea to illustrate 
how the Amzi! Logic Server can be used to provide the services of Prolog in conventional 
application environments. Given a genealogical database of information about people, 
the application lets you pose queries about various relationships, such as sister, 
uncle, grandparent, and ancestor. This implementation was built with three tools. 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Visual Basic</b> was used for the GUI interface (other GUI tools such
as Delphi or C++ could have been used instead),</li>

<li>
<b>Amzi! Prolog</b> was used to define the rules for family relationships,
and</li>

<li>
<b>Access</b> was used for the database of people (any database with an
ODBC driver could be used).</li>
</ul>
The glue for the application is the Amzi! Logic Server. The application:
<ul>
<li>
Uses the <b>Logic Server API </b>to get easy access from Visual to the
Prolog logic base, and</li>

<li>
Uses the <b>Logic Server ODBC extension</b> to lets the Prolog rules reason
directly over the database tables.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building the Sample</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open the dbgene project in the prolog subdirectory and rebuild it. This 
    compiles dbgene.pro and links it with the aodbc and misc libraries.</li>
  <li>Open the odbcgene project in Visual Basic and build odbcgene.exe.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
<p>To run it you need: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Install ODBC 2.0 or later.</li>
  <li>Make sure 'aodbc.lsx' is somewhere in your path (it is in amzi\bin).</li>
  <li> An amzi.cfg file containing the line 'lsxload=aodbc'.</li>
  <li>Create adata source named 'gene' in your 32-bit ODBC administrator (in the 
    Control Panel) that uses the gene.mdb database included with this demo. </li>
</ol>
<h2>

<hr></h2>

<h2>
<a NAME="UsingDBGene"></a>Using DBGene</h2>
To run DBGene, you need:
<ol>
<li>
ODBC (2.0 or later) installed</li>

<li>
AODBC.LSX somewhere in your path (it is in amzi\bin)</li>

<li>
a data source named 'gene' defined in your 32-bit ODBC administrator (in
the control panel) that uses the gene.mdb database included with this demo.</li>
</ol>
DBGene automatically loads the ODBC database, ‘gene’ and the logic base,
‘dbgene’. The lefthand listbox contains the names of the people in the
gene database. The middle listbox contains a list of the relations the
dbgene logic base knows about. If you select a relation and an individual,
then press the ‘query’ button, the names of the people who satisfy that
relation appear in the right hand box.
<p>If you have the tools to modify the database, which was created using
Microsoft Access, you can fill it with individuals from your own family
tree. Or you can replace the gene database with an ODBC database of your
own choosing.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="DBGENEApplicationArchitecture"></a>DBGENE Application Architecture</h2>
The DBGene application is composed of three components
<ul>
<li>
the Visual Basic user interface,</li>

<li>
the Amzi! Prolog logic base, and</li>

<li>
the Access database of people.</li>
</ul>
The <a href="#Database">database</a> contains two tables, one defining
people, with information such as a unique ID number, name, date-of-birth,
and parents, and the other defining marriages, with the ID numbers of the
individuals in each marriage.
<p>The <a href="#LogicBase">logic base</a> contains rules that define relationships
based on the database. These are rules that express what it means to be
a sibling, uncle, ancestor, etc. At the base of each of these rules are
Prolog predicates that map directly to the database, using the Logic Server
ODBC extension.
<p>The <a href="#UserInterface">user interface</a> contains list boxes
that present the pertinent information from the logic base. That information
is obtained from a Visual Basic program that uses logic base services.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Database"></a>Database</h2>
The database used in this example is an Access database. If you have Access,
you can edit it directly to reflect your own family tree. If you have a
different database with an ODBC driver, you can create tables like these
for your own family and assign the ODBC database name ‘gene’ to your database.
<p>There are two tables in the database defined as follows.
<p><b>Person</b>
<ul>
<pre><font color="#000080">*pid number (key)
*surname text[40] (indexed)
*midname....text[40]
*name text[40]
*gender text[1] m/f
*mother number (indexed) (a pid)
*father number (indexed) (a pid)
dob text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
dod text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
birthplace text[50]
nation text[40]
note text[255]</font></pre>
</ul>
<b>Marriage</b>
<ul>
<pre><font color="#000080">*husband number (indexed) (a pid)
*wife number (indexed) (a pid)
married text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
divorced text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
note text[255]</font></pre>
</ul>
* - Fields that are used in this demonstration. Other fields are ignored.
<h3>
The Sample People</h3>
The people in the sample database have decided to propagate maternal family
names through the middle name, just as paternal family names are often
propagated by the last name. That is, the children of a marriage take the
middle name of the mother and the last name of the father. That way the
daughters carry on the maternal family name and the sons carry on the paternal
family names, and you can get a better sense by looking at the names who
might be related to whom.
<p>Individuals with no middle name are at the top of the tree, also indicated
by parents with PID numbers of 0.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="LogicBase"></a>Logic Base</h2>
This is the Prolog code used to define the genealogical logic base. To
use it the host language must first open the ODBC connection by calling
the db_open/1 predicate.
<p>The <a href="dbgene.pro">code</a> consists of these primary sections:
<ul>
<li>
A list of relations, used by the host language to display the choices to
the user.</li>

<li>
Database definitions used to build SQL queries from Prolog queries.</li>

<li>
The rules defining the primitive relationships that are based directly
on the representation of people in the database. These rules make heavy
use of the ODBC query predicate.</li>

<li>
The higher-level rules for more complex relationships, all defined using
the primitive rules described above, so they are not affected by changes
to the representation of a person.</li>

<li>
The query interface designed for use from a host language program. Other
versions of the program have different interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="UserInterface"></a>User Interface</h2>
The Visual Basic user interface consists of a simple dialog box and some
functions that call the Prolog services portion of the application, and
populate the list boxes of the dialog.
<p>The code included is:
<ul>
<li>
dbgenevb.frm - the logic-base is initialized and closed with the form loading
and unloading. Three routines fill the three list boxes via calls to Prolog
for the logic server API.</li>
</ul>
