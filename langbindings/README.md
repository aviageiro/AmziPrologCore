# Language bindings
External language bindings to Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server

This is a single project with subdirectories for all the various language bindings to Amzi!.  Adding new language bindings is often fun and relatively easy.  See the apls/devdocs.md file for details.

All of these language bindings require access to an installed copy of Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server.  This just requires unzipping the distribution file in a directory.  It is not necessary to install the Eclipse IDE to work on the language bindings.

It is usually helpful, or maybe even necessary to set the AMZI_DIR environment variable to point to the amzi/apls directory.  Other variables might need to be set to point to the bin, include, and lib subdirectories of amzi/apls.
