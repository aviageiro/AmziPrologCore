<h1>java20</h1>
<p>The Java builds require building a shared library (.dll or .so) for the Java 
  Native Interface that connects the Logic Server shared library with the Logic 
  Server Java classes.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>The Java source is in the amzi\ls directory, because it will be the amzi.ls 
  packet. The DLL source is in the dll directory with a MS VC++ project. The makefile 
  does the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>compiles the Java Logic Server classes,</li>
  <li>uses javah to create the C/C++ header files for the classes, and</li>
  <li>calls Microsoft nmake for building the amzijni.dll.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can build the DLL directly from Microsoft VC++, but if you are building 
  it from the console, you must first open the project and export the .mak file 
  with dependencies.</p>
