# Amzi! Prolog Compiler (binaries)

The [compiler sources](https://github.com/AmziLS/AmziPrologCompiler) build acmp.xpl.  They are written in Amzi! Prolog.  (Prolog is a good language for compilers.)

Because Amzi! Prolog binaries are machine independent, acmp.xpl will run in any environment once the Amzi! engine (virtual machine, Warren Abstrace Machine (WAM)) is ported to that environment.  This means it is rarely necessary to change the compiler.
