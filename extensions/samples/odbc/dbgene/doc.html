   <title>DBGene -- ODBC C++ Genealogical Sample</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1> <b><font color="#0000FF">C++ ODBC Genealogical Sample</font></b></h1>
<p>The DBGene sample application uses a classic Prolog application idea to illustrate 
  how the Amzi! Logic Server can be used to provide the services of Prolog in 
  conventional application environments. Given a genealogical database of information 
  about people, the application lets you pose queries about various relationships, 
  such as sister, uncle, grandparent, and ancestor. </p>
<p>This implementation was built with three tools: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Visual C++</b> was used for the GUI interface (other GUI tools such 
    as Delphi or VB could have been used instead),</li>
  <li> <b>Amzi! Prolog</b> was used to define the rules for family relationships, 
    and</li>
  <li> <b>Access</b> was used for the database of people (any database with an 
    ODBC driver could be used).</li>
</ul>
The glue for the application is the Amzi! Logic Server. The application: 
<ul>
  <li> Uses the <b>Logic Server API </b>to get easy access from Visual C++ to 
    the Prolog logic base, and</li>
  <li> Uses the <b>Logic Server ODBC extension</b> to lets the Prolog rules reason 
    directly over the database tables.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="stand_alone"></a>Running Stand-Alone Prolog version</h2>
<p>Simply open the project in Eclipse and run the project, either interpreted 
  or compiled. The dbgene.pro file can also be run as a single file. Follow the 
  prompts.</p>
<p>Running an Prolog program that uses ODBC requires two things: 1) to load the 
  LSX amzi/bin/aodbc.lsx; and 2) to load the PLM amzi/abin/aodbc.plm. These can 
  be done directly in the source code of the application file:</p>
<pre>% Load the LSX that provides the extended predicates
% for the ODBC interface. This could also be done
% from amzi.cfg, or from a Logic Server host language
% program.</pre>
<pre>:- loadlsx('aodbc.lsx').</pre>
<pre>% Make user the Prolog portion of the ODBC library,
% which provides a Prolog-like interface to the
% database, is loaded, and that its predicates are
% imported.</pre>
<pre>:- ensure_loaded(aodbc).
:- import(aodbc).
</pre>
<p>AODBC.LSX could also be loaded using amzi.cfg, but the direct loading method 
  above is easier. See Amzi! runtime documentation for details on using amzi.cfg 
  for loading LSXs.</p>
<p>AODBC.PLM could be linked with the program, which is preferred for running 
  a compiled application. When that is done, the .plm is linked into the application 
  .xpl file.</p>
<p>In the Eclipse project for DBGENE, you can also specify in the project properties 
  that AODBC LSX and PLM are needed, and then, when running or building in Eclipse, 
  the correct files will be loaded. Note that using <b>ensure_loaded/1</b> means 
  that aodbc.plm will be loaded only if it hasn't already been loaded, say by 
  Eclipse or being linked into a .xpl file.</p>
<h2>Building the C++ Sample</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open the C++ Project in Visual Studio and build dbgene.exe</li>
  <li>Build the Prolog project by compiling dbgene.pro and linking it with the 
    aodbc library.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Running the C++ Sample</h2>
<p>To run it you need: 
<ol>
  <li> ODBC 2.0 installed</li>
  <li> AODBC.LSX somewhere in your path (it is in amzi\bin).</li>
  <li> A data source named 'gene' defined in your 32-bit ODBC administrator (in 
    the control panel) that uses the gene.mdb database included with this demo.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="UsingDBGene"></a>Using DBGene</h2>
To use DBGene, you must have ODBC installed and the Microsoft Access driver.
Use the ODBC control panel to add a data source named ‘gene’ that accesses
the gene.mdb.
<p>DBGene automatically loads the ODBC database, ‘gene’ and the logic base,
‘dbgene’. The middle listbox contains the names of the people in the gene
database. The left hand listbox contains a list of the relations the dbgene
logic base knows about. If you select a relation and an individual and
push the ‘Query’ button, the names of the people who satisfy that relation
appear in the right hand box.
<p>If you have the tools to modify the database, which was created using
Microsoft Access, you can fill it with individuals from your own family
tree. Or you can replace the gene database with an ODBC database of your
own choosing.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="DBGeneApplicationArchitecture"></a>DBGENE Application Architecture</h2>
The DBGene application is composed of three components
<ul>
<li>
the <b>Visual C++</b> user interface,</li>

<li>
the <b>Amzi! Prolog</b> logic base, and</li>

<li>
the <b>Access</b> database of people.</li>
</ul>
The <a href="#Database">database</a> contains two tables, one defining
people, with information such as a unique ID number, name, date-of-birth,
and parents, and the other defining marriages, with the ID numbers of the
individuals in each marriage.
<p>The <a href="#LogicBase">logic base</a> contains rules that define
relationships based on the database. These are rules that express what
it means to be a sibling, uncle, ancestor, etc. At the base of each of
these rules are Prolog predicates that map directly to the database, using
the Logic Server ODBC extension.
<p>The <a href="#UserInterface">user interface</a> contains list boxes
that present the pertinent information from the logic base. That information
is obtained from a C++ class that encapsulates the logic base services.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Database"></a>Database</h2>
The database used in this example is an Access database. If you have Access,
you can edit it directly to reflect your own family tree. If you have a
different database with an ODBC driver, you can create tables like these
for your own family and assign the ODBC database name ‘gene’ to your database.
<p>There are two tables in the database defined as follows.
<p><b>Person</b>
<ul>
<pre><font color="#000080">*pid number (key)
*surname text[40] (indexed)
*midname....text[40]
*name text[40]
*gender text[1] m/f
*mother number (indexed) (a pid)
*father number (indexed) (a pid)
dob text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
dod text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
birthplace text[50]
nation text[40]
note text[255]</font></pre>
</ul>
<b>Marriage</b>
<ul>
<pre><font color="#000080">*husband number (indexed) (a pid)
*wife number (indexed) (a pid)
married text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
divorced text[10] (date yyyy-mm-dd)
note text[255]</font></pre>
</ul>
* - Fields that are used in this demonstration. Other fields are ignored.
<h3>
The Sample People</h3>
The people in the sample database have decided to propagate maternal family
names through the middle name, just as paternal family names are often
propagated by the last name. That is, the children of a marriage take the
middle name of the mother and the last name of the father. That way the
daughters carry on the maternal family name and the sons carry on the paternal
family names, and you can get a better sense by looking at the names who
might be related to whom.
<p>Individuals with the same middle and last name are the top of the ancestral 
  tree and also have parents indicated by the PersonID 0. 
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2> <a name="LogicBase"></a>Logic Base</h2>
This is the Prolog code used to define the genealogical logic base. To use it 
the host language must first open the ODBC connection by calling the db_open/1 
predicate. 
<p>The <a href="dbgene.pro">code</a> consists of these primary sections:
<ul>
<li>
A list of relations, used by the host language to display the choices to
the user.</li>

<li>
Database definitions used to build SQL queries from Prolog queries.</li>

<li>
The rules defining the primitive relationships that are based directly
on the representation of people in the database. These rules make heavy
use of the ODBC query predicate.</li>

<li>
The higher-level rules for more complex relationships, all defined using
the primitive rules described above, so they are not affected by changes
to the representation of a person.</li>
</ul>
The query interface designed for use from a host language program. Other
versions of the program have different interfaces.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="UserInterface"></a>User Interface</h2>
The Visual C++ interface consists of a simple dialog box and a class that
encapsulates the Prolog services portion of the application, used to populate
the list boxes of the dialog.
<p>Some of the files in the application are pure boiler plate generated
by the application wizard of Visual C++. That code is not included here.
The code listed is:
<p><a href="progene.h">progene.h</a> - the header file for the class that
encapsulates the Prolog services, based on the Logic Server C++ wrapper
class.
<p><a href="progene.cpp">progene.cpp</a> - the implementation file for
the ProGene class. Its primary function is to take one of the three list
boxes of the application as input and fill it with the appropriate information
derived from the Logic Base. API calls that loop through lists and queries
are used to generate all the information required for each list box.
<p><a href="dbgendlg.cpp">dbgendlg.cpp</a> - the main dialog implementation
that use the ProGene services. The OnInitDialog function calls ProGene
to fill up the relations and individuals list boxes, and the OnQuery function
passes the selected name and relation to ProGene, which then fills in the
answers list box.
